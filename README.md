Ten Digit Sorting

Given an array A of N integers. Sort the array in increasing order of the value at the tens place digit of every number.

If a number has no tens digit, we can assume value to be 0.If 2 numbers have same tens digit, in that case number with max value will come firstSolution should be based on comparator.

Example Input

Input 1:
A = [15, 11, 7, 19]

Input 2:
A = [2, 24, 22, 19]

Example Output

Output 1:
[7, 19, 15, 11]

Output 2:
[2, 19, 24, 22]
